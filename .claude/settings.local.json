      "Bash(git -C \"c:\\\\Users\\\\dimsh\\\\Downloads\\\\Pong-test\" commit -m \"$\\(cat <<''EOF''\nFix Snake head-to-head collision bug \\(v3.25.15\\)\n\nCRITICAL BUG FIX:\n\nRoot Cause:\n- Collision detection loop checked ALL segments starting from i=0\n- Segment[0] is the OTHER player''s HEAD\n- When two heads collided, BOTH snakes detected collision\n- Race condition caused wrong snake to die\n- User reported: \"умерла та змейка в которую врезались, а не та, которая врезалась\"\n\nSolution:\n- Changed collision loop to start from i=1 instead of i=0 \\(server.js:3904\\)\n- Now only checks BODY segments \\(skips head at index 0\\)\n- Head-to-head collisions no longer trigger death\n- Only head-into-body collisions cause death\n\nTechnical Details:\n- Old: for \\(let i = 0; i < otherPlayer.segments.length; i++\\)\n- New: for \\(let i = 1; i < otherPlayer.segments.length; i++\\)\n- Added debug logging: [COLLISION] with segment index and player names\n- Follows classic Snake mechanics: head can only die by hitting body\n\nThis aligns with traditional Snake game rules where head-to-head\nmeetings don''t cause death, only head-into-body collisions.\n\nBump version to 3.25.15\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]\\(https://claude.com/claude-code\\)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
